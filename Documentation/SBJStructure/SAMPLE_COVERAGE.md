# SubjectEditor Preview Coverage

`SBJStructuredEditorPreview.swift` is intentionally a **compile/sample fixture** for
SubjectEditor and the SBJStructure subsystem of SBJFoundation. It is allowed to be
contrived. Its job is not merely to look like a realistic recipe editor; its job is
to keep framework coverage visible while still providing a usable editor preview.

SBJFoundation is broader than SBJStructure and also contains reusable platform/application-foundation utilities. General-purpose
foundation/UI utilities do not have to be forced into SubjectEditor merely to be
covered, but anything outside the Preview dependency path must have a clear useful
purpose or be explicitly marked for review.

This document lives with the SBJStructure subsystem documentation under `Documentation/SBJStructure/`.

## Coverage definition

There are two rules.

### Annotation coverage

**Every SBJStructure annotation must be literally declared somewhere in
`SBJStructuredEditorPreview.swift`.**

The Preview does not need to exercise every annotation parameter or every enum case.
One representative declaration is enough to make the annotation itself part of the
sample's compile surface.

If a new annotation is added, the Preview is incomplete until it declares it.

### Type/file coverage

A framework type or source dependency is considered covered when the Preview's
compile path reaches it, directly or transitively, without relying on an external
application plug-in/strategy.

The practical test is:

> If this code type were removed, would the SubjectEditor Preview still build?

Examples:

- `CodableColor` is covered because the Preview model declares a `CodableColor`
  property and the editor dispatches through the color-editor path.
- `CodableFont` and `CodableFontCache` become covered transitively because the
  Preview declares `@SBJPresentation(.fontFamily)` and the font-family editor uses
  the cache/type.
- collection mutation helpers used by the Set/Dictionary editors are covered even
  though the Preview does not spell their method names.
- an enum does **not** need every case exercised. Removing the enum type must break
  the Preview build; removing one unused case is outside this definition.
- sharing a file with a covered type is not sufficient. A type can therefore be
  outside the Preview dependency path while still being an intentional App Foundation
  API with real application consumers. `ColorVariants` is an example.

This is compile dependency coverage, not runtime branch coverage and not test
coverage. Focused tests remain appropriate for parameter combinations, edge cases,
and behavior.

## Annotation checklist

The Preview currently declares every annotation in `Sources/SBJFoundation/SBJStructure/Annotations`:

- `@SBJStructure` — structs and an associated-value enum.
- `@SBJArray` — ingredients and steps.
- `@SBJColor` — recipe-card tint.
- `@SBJData` — a small import fingerprint, exercising Data invariants/editor.
- `@SBJDate` — last-made date.
- `@SBJDesignatedInit` — `RecipeNutrition` initializer. This is intentionally
  present even though its primary consumer is Swift-source export.
- `@SBJDictionary` — substitutions.
- `@SBJEditorProperty` — editor-only computed display-name adapter.
- `@SBJInteger` — servings and time fields.
- `@SBJNotEditable` — import source.
- `@SBJNumber` — nutrition/ingredient quantities.
- `@SBJOptional` — source URL presence requirement.
- `@SBJPresentation` — recipe-card font family.
- `@SBJSet` — tags.
- `@SBJString` — single-line, multiline, and sheet-edit examples. The annotation is
  the coverage unit; multiple styles are retained because they exercise distinct
  editor paths and are useful visually.
- `@SBJURL` — network-only source URL.
- `@SBJUUID` — nonzero identifier.

When an annotation is added or removed, update this checklist and the Preview in the
same change.

## Major dependencies covered transitively by SubjectEditor

The Preview's editor path reaches substantially more than the declarations visible
in the fixture. Important examples include:

- generated `SBJStructured`, `SBJEditable`, `SBJSwiftUIEditable`, and associated-enum
  conformances/metadata;
- structural comparison, content inspection, default-value creation, invariant
  checking, validation key paths, issues/diagnostics, and traversal/search state;
- scalar and collection typed-editor dispatch, bindings, row/disclosure chrome,
  field sizing, changed/empty/invalid state, accessibility semantics, and editor
  search;
- Set replacement and Dictionary key-renaming mutation helpers;
- Data hex parsing/formatting through `@SBJData` / `SBJDataEditor`;
- UUID parsing/zero checking through `@SBJUUID`, validation, and `SBJUUIDEditor`;
- URL parsing/open behavior and `URLButton` through `@SBJURL` / `SBJURLEditor`;
- `CodableColor` and color editing;
- `CodableFont` / `CodableFontCache` through the font-family presentation editor; directory placement does not affect this transitive coverage;
- `PlaceholderMultilineTextField` and shared multiline chrome through
  `@SBJString(.sheetEdit)`;
- `SBJCompactMenuLabel`, `SBJUIAppearance`, focus/invalid modifiers,
  `SearchField`, and other UIVocabulary used by editor implementations;
- Swift-source encoder types referenced by the `SBJStructured` contract and the
  designated-initializer metadata path.

The important point is not whether the Preview names these APIs. If removing the
code type breaks a file on the Preview dependency path, it is covered by this
working definition.

## Not covered by SubjectEditor, but valid App Foundation

The following are intentionally outside the Preview dependency path today. Their
absence is not a problem because each has a useful application-foundation role.
They should not be inserted into the recipe merely to force compile coverage.

### Persistence / observation

- `DefaultsStorage`, `DefaultsStorageValue`, `PropertyListType` — typed
  `UserDefaults` persistence.
- `ObserveToken` / `observeValue` — bridge Observation changes to controller/app
  callbacks with explicit cancellation/lifetime behavior.

### General UI vocabulary

- `ColorVariants` — application-facing color-source vocabulary used by SBJ applications.
  It remains intentionally valid outside SubjectEditor even though the Preview does not
  require it. It is also an input to the presentation-resource/color design.
- `ImageName` — **covered transitively by SubjectEditor** because editor button, status,
  and disclosure imagery now routes through the `ImageName` boundary. It also remains
  general application-facing UI vocabulary.
- `CollapsingMenu` — collapse one-or-many actions into the appropriate toolbar/menu
  presentation.
- `NumberTextField` — **covered transitively by SubjectEditor** because
  `SBJIntegerEditor` uses it as the canonical reusable integer input. Range validity,
  locale formatting, chrome, sizing, and keyboard behavior therefore share one
  implementation; the structured editor adds its property label/accessibility and Stepper.
- `PendingAlert` / `Alertable` / `.pendingAlert(...)` — reusable alert state and
  view presentation; also a concrete input to the localization design.
- `URLText` — reusable read/display URL presentation. (`URLButton` itself is
  covered by the URL editor.)
- `AccessibleImage` / `AccessibleImageItem` — reusable image accessibility model.

### General Foundation/system extensions

- `ImageSource` plus its UIKit image-resolution bridge — UI-independent image
  source identity/resolution for app/document code.
- `IdentifiableImage` / UIImage conveniences — identity/loading helpers for UIKit
  image consumers.
- filename sanitization helpers — filesystem-safe user/document names.
- generic String parsing conveniences (`unjoined`, `signedDescription`,
  `isEquivalent`, replacement-table helper) — app/domain string utilities.
- NSError/process-environment diagnostic conveniences — debugging/platform
  helpers.

These are good candidates for a SBJFoundation documentation section rather
than SubjectEditor examples.

## Policy for new code

For each new framework addition:

1. **Is it an annotation?**
   - Declare it in `SBJStructuredEditorPreview.swift`, even if the fixture must be
     contorted to do so.
2. **Does the existing Preview/editor compile path reach the new type?**
   - If yes, it is covered under this document's definition.
3. **If not, is it a useful App Foundation primitive?**
   - Keep it outside SubjectEditor and record its purpose here (or in the future
     App Foundation documentation).
4. **If not covered and there is no clear independent use?**
   - Add an explicit source comment marking it for API review. Do not let it appear
     covered merely because it shares a file with something the Preview uses.

SubjectEditor is therefore deliberately a kitchen-sink **annotation and editor
compile fixture**, while App Foundation utilities remain separate when forcing them
into the sample would test nothing about SubjectEditor.
